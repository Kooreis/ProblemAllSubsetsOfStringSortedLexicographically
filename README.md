# Question: How do you find all subsets of a string and sort them lexicographically? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code defines a function named `getSubsets` that takes a string as an input and returns all possible subsets of the string, sorted lexicographically. The function first converts the input string into an array of characters. It then initializes a base array with an empty string. The function uses the `reduce` method to iterate over each character in the array. For each character, it concatenates the character with each element in the previous array and adds the result to the previous array. This process generates all possible subsets of the input string. Finally, the function sorts the resulting array of subsets lexicographically using the `sort` method and returns the sorted array. When the function is called with the string 'abc', it prints all subsets of 'abc', sorted leicographically.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version solves the problem in a slightly different way than the JavaScript version. Instead of using the `reduce` method to generate all subsets of the string, it uses two nested loops to generate all possible substrings of the input string. It then adds these substrings to an array and sorts the array. 

The TypeScript version also uses static typing, which is a feature not available in JavaScript. The function `findSubsets` is declared to take a string as input and return an array of strings. The variable `array` is also declared as an array of strings. This can help prevent bugs and make the code easier to understand.

The TypeScript version also uses the `slice` method to generate substrings, while the JavaScript version uses string concatenation to generate subsets. The `slice` method returns a new string that includes the characters from the start index up to, but not including, the end index. This is different from the JavaScript version, which generates subsets by concatenating the current element to each of the previous subsets.

In terms of performance, both versions have a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops (or the `reduce` and `map` methods in the JavaScript version). However, the TypeScript version may be slightly faster because it uses the `slice` method instead of string concatenation.

# C++ Differences

The JavaScript version uses the `reduce` function to generate all subsets of the string. It starts with an array containing an empty string and for each character in the input string, it concatenates the character to each string in the array and adds the new strings to the array. Finally, it sorts the array of subsets lexicographically using the `sort` function.

The C++ version uses a different approach. It generates all subsets by treating each subset as a binary number where each bit represents whether a character is included in the subset or not. It iterates over all numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1 (where n is the length of the string) and for each number, it generates a subset by including the characters at the positions where the number has a 1 bit. It uses bitwise operations to check if a bit is set and to iterate over the bits of the number. Finally, it sorts the vector of subsets lexicographically using the `sort` function from the Standard Template Library (STL).

The main differences between the two versions are the way they generate the subsets and the language features they use. The JavaScript version uses higher-order functions and array methods, while the C++ version uses bitwise operations and STL functions. The C++ version also uses a vector to store the subsets and it passes this vector by reference to the function that generates the subsets, while the JavaScript version returns a new array from the `getSubsets` function.
